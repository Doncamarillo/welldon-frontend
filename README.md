## concept

Weldon (pronounced well done), a social media site for developers. Essententially weldon is a place for developers to showcase their best work for the public to see and potentially even learn from, whether its learning more about that specific project or learning more about the user that posted it. 

## functionality

Users on Weldon are able to create and sign in to their accounts. Once signed in users can post their own projects with the title, a description about what the project is, a deployed link to the project and when that posts a link to the user's profile who posted it. Upon registering for a profile, the user may also upload their github, youtube, twitter @ , and their linkedin so for whoever finds the project may see what other work that user has posted throughout the web.
